    "\n",
    "### A **framework** that integrates Darshan + LDMS to provide low-latency monitoring of I/O events during runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Darshan](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/darshan/)**: a lightweight I/O characterization tool used to capture I/O access information in memory during the execution of HPC applications. After a job running with Darshan finishes executing, Darshan merges I/O data from all processes and generates a profile document and, optionally, also a trace file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Lightweight Distributed Metric Service (LDMS)](https://ovis-hpc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ldms/ldms-quickstart.html)**: a low-overhead production monitoring system for HPC machines. It has the capability to collect, transport, aggregate and store timeseries data during runtime. Example of system performance metrics collected are CPU, memory, power, and storage.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Main benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collecting system and I/O traces at the same time in a **single file**\n",
    "- Data is monitored and recorded continuously **throughout the execution of the program** (as opposed to only aggregating the data at the end of execution)\n",
    "- Captures **absolute time-series data** with high precision: can be used to correlate application-specific events with system utilization activities\n",
    "- Captures read/write/**close/open/flushes**\n",
    "- Captures POSIX, MPI-IO and stdio, distinguishing between **STDIN/STDOUT/STDERR** \n",
    "- Stores all application processes in **JSON or CSV** format, which facilitates processing by most data analysis tools\n",
    "- No changes in the code necessary\n",
